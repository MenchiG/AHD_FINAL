# EL6463- Advanced Hardware Design
## Final Project
### team name: 404 NOT FOUND
A 32-bit processor in VHDL, called NYU-6463 Processor
This project contains

+ VHDL codes of processor(with UCF)
+ Testbenches
+ RC5 asm codes
+ BIT FILE

Instead of using compiler, we compile asm code by hand.
Due to the constraint of the file size, demo is not here, but it locates in NYU class.
